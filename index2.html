    <P>The Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest terrestrial living animal in the world. They also the biggest ruminant
        in the world. Its specific name (camelopardalis)refers to its camel-like face and the patches of color on its fur
        seems like a leopard's spots. Giraffes belong to herbivore animals, so they eat leaves. They are big mammals, but
        they're tame.</P>


    <p>have very long neck and legs. Their tall body help them to identify their enemies (especially lions) while their enemies
        are hiding around them. The attacks of carnivores are rarely happened because of their big body and strong kick.
        However, a crocodile still can be a threat for giraffes while they're drinking. Giraffes are Africa's endemic animal.
        They usually live in savannas, grasslands, and other open areas in tropical zone. Their foods are leaves on trees.
        Their tall body help them eat leaves in high places that can't be gotten by other species. They also have long, flexible
        tongue to help them fetch leaves. While drinking, they open their legs to form inverted V. This method is used in
        order to help their mouth to reach the water.</p>
